# Blackjack-with-Alan-AI

Around April of 2020, I decided to learn JavaScript. I worked my way through Rafeh Qazi's JavaScript tutorial on YouTube, and followed along while he created multiple projects. These projects included Rock Paper Scissors, a Cat Generator, and my personal favorite, Blackjack. 

While working as an intern for Alan AI under the PilotCity 2021 Flagship, I developed new JavaScript-based features for the Blackjack game, and added voice assitant features and interactions to the project to make the user experience more engaging for the users. These features allow users to simply communicate their commands with a voice assitant based on Alan AI technology, and have a hands-free experience at a game of Blackjack.
